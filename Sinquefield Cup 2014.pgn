Magnus plays an extremely rare move.}  7... a5 { Diagram # This was played in
the Ukranian Championship by Elijanov. White played 8.a4, preventing black from

I don't understand how MVL could have anazlyed 7...a5 so deeply, since this
move is played less than 1% of the time! Instead, Magnus seemed surprised by
the Stockfish recommended 13.Bc4, and went into the tank.}  13... Nb4 $1 {
Played after 30 minutes of thought. This move, and 13...Bd4 are the engine
recommended moves. Alejandro, at first, thought there was no way Magnus would
play this  ( I heard this before last year, and Magnus usually played the
"computer move" in these situations ) .}  14. Nxb4 { And MVL also thought about
25 minutes on his response! Even though he clearly prepared this variation, he
either did not know, or forgot this move. Now both player were clearly on their
own.}  14... d5 { The point of Nb4... now the powerful white Nd5 is missing,
and white has many pieces pinned and attacked.}  15. Qf4 dxc4 16. O-O bxc2 $1 {
